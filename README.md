## Forking and/or Cloning

If you want to get this code down to your computer to play around with, you can just click that green button and use the GitHub CLI to `clone` it: `gh repo clone SWIC-177/tailwind-demo`. Just make sure that it's not being cloned into any other repo! From there, it's the same: `cd` into the newly cloned directory (you can do `ls` first). And then `npm i`, etc. etc. etc.

Just cloning it though will not allow you to **push** any updates. You probably don't need to as you are supposed to work on your own repo from before. But, in case you do, you just need to [click that 'Fork' button in the top right.](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) That will make a copy to your own GitHub account and then you can `clone` it.

BTW, this forking process is what happens automatically whenever we use GitHub Classroom.
